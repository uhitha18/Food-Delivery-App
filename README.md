//
//React Element



//JSX- HTML like or XML like syntax
//jsx is converted to react elemenet (babel does this)
//our js engine does not directly understand jsx

//React components

//class based components -OLD WAY
//functional components -NEW WAY
//The above is called component composition (putting a component inside a component)

//above both syntaxes are correct




//Afunction which is returning a piece of jsx is called functional component
